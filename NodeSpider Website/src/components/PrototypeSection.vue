                    A sleek, durable stainless steel mailbox that can endure any weather. 
                    It has sensors to detect light, motion, and temperature, and a button to press when a delivery is made. 
                    A companion phone app allows you to accept or reject a delivery, track mail and parcels, and monitor mailbox trends at your fingertips. 
                    Lastly, its tamper alarm keeps thieves and animals away from your mail.

                    Our Smart Mailbox combines mechanical and software engineering to deliver automation and ease of use. 
                    A tiny Arduino microcontroller inside the mailbox has sensors for humidity and temperature control. 
                    There is also a motion sensor, microphone and camera!
                    A WiFi/Bluetooth chip on the board easily connects to a router. 
                    It will send the sensorsâ€™ data to a custom-built cloud web server using the robust Django framework, which in return will store data in its PostgreSQL database.

                    Once the product launches, we will pitch the idea to Australia Post / DHL / FedEx to integrate our Smart Mailbox with their systems. 
                    We could also collaborate with key opinion leaders (KOLs) and online stores and promote the product through word-of-mouth.
