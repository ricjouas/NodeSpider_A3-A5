                    <h3>About 20 years ago, I had planned to study architecture. However, while assessing what the future would look like, my grandfather said that everyone was going to have technology in their hands. Hence, I did not accept my university offer to be an architect. 
                        From there, I went down the IT path and got professional certifications. Finally, I landed a job and worked my way through the industry.

                        <h3>I had different mentors at various stages of my career. In the early stages of my career, I had a technical mentor who guided me through professional certifications and education. It is good to have someone to teach you how to diversify your skill sets. 
                            Having a fantastic mentor was crucial in my career, as it allowed me to explore a multitude of technologies and various areas of IT. 
                            As I progressed through my career into a managerial role, my HR manager became my mentor — he taught me how to interact with people and manage staff. 
                            More recently, my mentors have been guiding me through executive levels of work; that is where I branched off into doing my MBA. 
                            You will find these mentors throughout your careers; you just need to know the area of work you wish to focus on.

                    <h3>Getting my foot in the door was the hardest so I would recommend anyone to volunteer their time to get experience or to find a traineeship. 
                        Like anyone, I started at the bottom. My very first job was delivering monitors and I didn’t even have a proper desk. 
                        Thankfully, I had good guidance from my mentors who told me I didn’t need to climb to the top right away; your career journey is a marathon, not a sprint. 
                        It’s important to master what you are currently learning before moving up.
                         
                        One cannot attribute success solely to luck. However, I do feel I was lucky when doors opened for me at the right time. I took advantage of those opportunities and ended up working at the help desk. Eventually, I was given more tasks and naturally became a system administrator, where I was exposed to a multitude of technologies. 
                        At one point, I was skilled in an area of IT where not many people were skilled in — that gave me the opportunity to put my hand up to be a manager and I was determined not to let my team down.
                         
                        At GHD, I was a manager for 17 years. I also did freelance work for a while and dabbled in web development, design and small business setups. 
                        From there, opportunities opened up in GHD as the company grew. 
                        I joined GHD when there were 800 staff and at the end of my 17th year, there were almost 11,000. Hence, the company required system upgrades, which opened up promotions and growth in that space.
                         
                        I then became the Global Technology Manager, which allowed me to travel the world and represent technology companies. 
                        As more opportunities arose, I joined two of Hewlett-Packard (HP)’s advisory boards; one in technology and the other in the customer space. That meant I could provide direct input for the development of new products. 
                        Likewise, I sat on the executive advisory board for Riverbed in America, where we looked at products and delivery, and worked with product development teams.
                         
                        When it was time for an industry change, I moved from an engineering professional services company to an automotive retail company, Frizelle Sunshine Automotive. 
                        At Frizelle, I moved into my current CIO role. We now have over 2,000 staff and manage over 36 brands, including Ferrari, Volkswagen, and other premium brands.

                        I have to know how the business is working and what our vision is; that could involve deciding if investments could be wasted down the line. 
                        Therefore, I liaise with senior executives in the board to track our progress and forecast plans.
                         
                        The second part of my job is staff management. I’m a firm believer in developing career pathways so I must ensure that managers are delivering these pathways to their teams. 
                        I make sure that teams are staying on track with projects and delivering business plans. 
                        For example, we would develop a quarterly or yearly business plan to ensure we are on track with projects. Sometimes, we have to realign projects if, for example, there is a business acquisition.

                            On other days, I could be engaging with stakeholders, socialising, and understanding what’s happening on the ground. 
                            Part of my job is to ensure I have a finger on the pulse and know what’s going on in the company. I could be working on anything related to staffing, project meetings, or even crisis meetings.

                                        Using technical terms may bamboozle a board or senior managers who may pretend to know what you are talking about. 
                                        Hence, it is important to turn technical jargon into business-focus wording and understand that your stakeholders and customers may just want to know how your idea will make their lives better or easier.

                        IT was something that could fundamentally assist you with tasks and now it’s displacing jobs and automating things to change lives. 
                        Back then, you had to use the internal terminal to send an email — now emails are things people expect.
                         
                        With automation, the impact of IT is that people have to rethink their jobs. 
                        Just like evolution across different industries, the technological revolution has made people wonder if their job would exist in 5 years. 
                        Kids now have to consider if their field of studies would lead to long-term career pathways; it is something I did not have to consider in the past.

                            There are plenty of roles in IT — data scientists, data architects, automation engineers, front end developers, and all sorts of roles that did not exist 20 years ago.
