                    Nodespider’s outcome for this project is to develop the foundations for a smart parcel mailbox that would one day replace the common home mailbox. Nodespider is taking into consideration key areas for the development of this product and we will need to first undergo research and testing before finalising this product.
 
The key areas under consideration include software, hardware, materials, financial and marketing aspects for the development. The software department will look at compatibility with your existing WiFi, iOS and Android systems, and also being user-friendly on mobile devices. The hardware department will need to look at the use of a microcontroller that controls input and outputs. The materials department will research and source t materials that are able to withstand harsh f weather conditions and are suitable for security purposes. The marketing research will look at existing competitors and current trends and the financial research will cover areas such as generating revenue for this product, the cost of the materials and development that needs to be undertaken.

                    According to Forbes (2020), a huge shift has taken place in the last decade, and pushed forward with a global pandemic, where the demand for home automation systems has continually increased to contribute to domestic help in new and innovative ways. The smart- home market is set to grow from 55 billion to 174 billion by 2025. This demonstrates a strong market with a global consumer base just waiting to be tapped into. Following this trend, the smart mailbox system we propose will be a welcome addition.  
 
                    Overall, the online shopping environment has seen unprecedented growth as the events of 2020 and beyond have had a profound effect on human behavior. Online shopping participation increased significantly in 2020, with around 4 and 5 households in Australia alone having bought an item online in the past year. One of the largest growth areas has been seen in homewares and appliances, which represented over half of all online purchases in Australia over the last financial year (Australia post 2020). 
                    Another motivation is to aid in increasing security measures in order to counteract parcel theft, which has seen a drastic increase over the last few years, with over seventeen percent of Australian adults said to have experienced parcel theft before on at least one occasion. Many of the thefts committed are said to have been opportunistic, whereby the parcels are usually left in plain sight and unattended for extended periods of time. Having a smart mailbox system with a visible security camera will serve as an effective deterrent and act as an incentive for potential investors (Grubb B 2017).  
 
                    This project therefore retains importance for all of the reasons listed above, and for a team of young developers just getting into the IT field, this project is interesting because it gives us a good insight into a technology that can have a great influence on many households. It allows us to interpret and understand real world data and how that data will influence our proposed technology. The project will also teach us how to plan and develop strategies for inevitable challenges while developing a project of this scale in a team setting.   
 
                    The ability to work on this project would demonstrate to a future employer a capability to identify consumers’ changing needs in an increasingly digital environment and to identify niche markets that are not oversaturated with competitors. It would also demonstrate the ability to think outside the box and to identify and understand appropriate data sources to make good decisions about a product, thereby increasing its chances of succeeding.
